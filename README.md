# V2X-Simulation
Simulation of V2X Communication using OMNET++ and Viens

This project is carried out as part of the V2X Mobile Communication course, under the supervision of Prof. Dominik Schoop at Esslingen University of Applied Sciences.

# Project Description 
- The project aims to simulate three vehicles on a map imported from SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility).
- The vehicles changes their IDs periodically to maintain anonymity.

# How to run the project
- First you should Install OMNET++ on your device.
- After setting up OMNET++ in you device Run the following command on CMD in windows: \veins\sumo-launchd.py -v 'sumo.exe file directory in your machine' 
- In case of VM/Linux device you can download Veins Virtual machine that includes all programs together SUMO, OMNET++ and, Veins from the following link: https://veins.car2x.org/documentation/instant-veins/
- Open OMNET++ import both Veins_new and v2x_PROJECT to your workspace.
- Add Veins as a refrance to v2x_PROJECT.
- Open v2x_PROJECT and run omnetpp.ini.
- You can see now OMNET++ Qtenv GUI you can run the simulation and see the messages.
